# FriendFinder

Friend Finder is an app that asks users a set of questions and returns their best friend match. The app sends users survey answers to the server and the server calculates and returns info on the users closest match based on the given answers. 
You can also view our JSON data of all stored friends using the route /api/friends either in the browser or in a AJAX GET request.

**Note** *After cloning this repository you will need to run npm install in order for Friend Finder to work properly*
